## 📝 Photography Tips

### For Before/After Photos:
1. **Same Position**: Stand in the exact same spot for before and after
2. **Same Time of Day**: Similar lighting makes comparison easier
3. **Clean the Space**: Remove clutter from shots
4. **Show Details**: Get close-ups of the coating/finish quality
5. **Multiple Angles**: Take wide shots and detail shots

### For Service Photos:
1. **Good Lighting**: Natural light is best, or use soft artificial light
2. **Focus on Quality**: Show the finish, texture, details
3. **Context**: Show the service in a real kitchen/bathroom setting
4. **Before AND After**: Always show the transformation

### General Tips:
- Use a good camera or modern smartphone
- Clean lens before shooting
- Hold camera steady or use a tripod
- Take multiple shots and choose the best
- Edit for brightness and color correction if needed
